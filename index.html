                <p style="text-align:justify">Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is a branch of artificial
                  intelligence capable of creating seemingly new, meaningful content, including text, images, and audio.
                  It utilizes deep learning models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to recognize and replicate
                  data patterns, enabling the generation of human-like content. Notable families of LLMs include GPT
                  (GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4), LLaMA (LLaMA and LLaMA-2), and Mistral (Mistral and Mixtral).
                  GPT, which stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer, is especially popular for text
                  generation and is widely used in applications like ChatGPT.
                  GenAI has taken the world by storm and revolutionized various industries, including healthcare,
                  finance, and entertainment. However, GenAI models have several limitations, including biases from
                  training data, generating factually incorrect information, and difficulty in understanding complex
                  content. Additionally, their performance can vary based on domain specificity.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">In recent times, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have attracted considerable
                  attention for their ability to represent structured and interconnected information, and adopted
                  by many companies in various domains. KGs represent knowledge by depicting relationships between entities,
                  known as facts, usually based on formal ontological models.  Consequently, they enable accuracy,
                  decisiveness, interpretability, domain-specific knowledge, and evolving knowledge in various AI applications.
                  The intersection between GenAI and KG has ignited significant interest and innovation in Natural Language
                  Processing (NLP). For instance, by integrating LLMs with KGs during pre-training and inference, external
                  knowledge can be incorporated for enhancing the modelâ€™s capabilities and improving interpretability.
                  When integrated, they offer a robust approach to problemsolving in diverse areas such as information
                  enrichment, representation learning, conversational AI, cross-domain AI transfer, bias, content generation,
                  and semantic understanding.

                  This workshop, aims to reinforce the relationships between Deep Learning, Knowledge Graphs, and NLP communities
                  and foster inter-disciplinary research in the area of GenAI.

                <h4>Towards cognitive-based knowledge engineering</h4>
                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                In recent years, a number of methodologies and tools have emerged in literature for building large knowledge graphs.
                Most of the focus on knowledge engineering (KE) techniques, i.e. the collection of activities for eliciting, capturing,
                conceptualising and formalising knowledge. However, KE tasks are extremely time-consuming and require a significant
                cognitive effort by knowledge engineers. More recently large-language models have shown promising results in many tasks
                related to knowledge engineering, such as knowledge extraction, ontology matching, schema induction, etc. An example is
                ChatGPT that can be used smoothly for generating knowledge graphs even starting from scenarios or competency questions.
                Following this research trend, neurosymbolic AI has been used for integrates neural and symbolic AI architectures to
                address the weaknesses of each in the context of KE, providing a robust AI capable of reasoning, learning, and
                generating knowledge graphs. But still a number of open issues remain open. One of them is about preserving the
                cognitive-soundness of traditional KE methodologies that were entirely human-centred. Prompting LLM with human
                metacognitive processes is a novel research direction that aims at instilling critical elements of human "thinking about
                thinking" into LLMs. The hypothesis is that metacognitive prompting can enhance the quality and cognitive-soundness of
                knowledge graphs resulting from KE processes.
                <h5>Bio</h5>

                <h4>CIMPLE: Hybridizing Knowledge Graph and LLM for Explaining
                    Factors Contributing to Misinformation</h4>
                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                In this talk, we will present some of the results of the CIMPLE project
                that makes use of generative AI to counter information manipulation. We
                present the CIMPLE Knowledge Graph that collects factchecks as well as
                claims and social media posts that convey some misinformation. We
                introduce the notion of factors that include political leaning, emotion,
                sentiment, the usage of propaganda and persuasion techniques or the
                support of conspiracy theories. We show to what extent LLM can be used
                to label misinformation and we present preliminary experiments that
                leverage knowledge graph embeddings to either identify misinformation
                spreaders, or to provide a finer-grained characterization of the phenomenon.
                <h5>Bio</h5>
                RaphaÃ«l Troncy is an Associate Professor at the Data Science Department
                of EURECOM, France since 2009, leading the Data-2-Knowledge team. His
                main research interest concerns the use of semantic web technologies for
                data integration, information extraction from text, tables and
                multimedia documents, and recommender systems. He has applied his
                research in diverse sectors such as Creative Industries, Cultural
                Heritage, Tourism, Automotive, ICT and Energy where the goal has been to
                produce specialized Knowledge Graphs and AI-based application for
                discovering and interacting with the data. He was General Chair of The
                Web Conference 2022 and he has published more than 250 papers.

                    Submissions can fall in one of the following categories:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Full research papers (6-8 pages)</li>
                        <li>Short research papers (4-6 pages)</li>
                        <li>Position papers (2 pages)</li>
                    </ul>
                    These page limits only apply to the main body of the paper. At the end of the paper (after the conclusions but before the references)
                    papers need to include a mandatory section discussing the limitations of the work and, optionally, a section discussing ethical considerations.
                    Papers can include unlimited pages of references and an unlimited appendix.
